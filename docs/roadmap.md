# Project Status and Roadmap

kruntimes is actively developed as a `v0.x experimental` project. APIs are
`v1alpha1` and may change before a stable release.

## Current Status

Completed foundations include:

- Run and Runtime CRDs.
- Warm Runtime Pod scheduling.
- Bash and Python built-in runtimes.
- bounded outputs and external artifact references.
- Runtime artifact cleanup through long-running maintainers.
- retry, timeout, cancellation, stale-pod recovery, and terminal conditions.
- Helm charts, release workflows, SBOM, signing, CLI releases, and benchmark
  harness.
- security, operations, release, compatibility, and custom Runtime docs.

## Near-Term Roadmap

### v0.x Experimental

- Keep public documentation aligned with implementation.
- Harden E2E coverage for scheduling, artifact cleanup, and workflow behavior.
- Improve CLI ergonomics and examples.
- Expand custom Runtime examples.
- Continue supply-chain and security hardening.

### Toward v1.0

- Stabilize CRD APIs.
- Define compatibility and migration guarantees.
- Document deprecation policy.
- Clarify multi-tenant isolation strategy for production environments.
- Publish stable installation and upgrade guidance.

## Open Source Readiness
